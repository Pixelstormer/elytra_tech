- New mechanics
    - Freelook mechanic
        - Allow looking around without changing your trajectory/heading
        - Controlled by dedicated keybind, can choose between toggle or hold
        - Camera snaps back to original orientation when turned off
        - Like in War Thunder
        - For looking at things without also flying towards them
        - For circling/hovering to observe things from a vantage point, without needing blocks to stand on
        - For balance: Must not allow no-risk landings
    - Auto start flying if midair for too long?
        - Make flying not a separate state, so player is 'flying' at all times when midair?
    - Alt. takeoff: boosting controlled by holding Sneak rather than camera pitch?
        - Or while sprinting, or transitioning from sprinting to sneaking, etc?

- Progression: Beacon on ender dragon respawning ritual?
    - Activate any level beacon such that beam intersects the epicenter of the ritual (The point where the beams converge and the dragon spawns)
    - When all the beams converge, jump into the epicenter while wearing elytra
        - The elytra is consumed and player gains innate flight and boosting, and the ritual is suppressed (Dragon doesn't spawn)
    - Does this consume the beacon or not?

- Fixes:
    - Improve interactions with water
        - Vanilla issue: Cannot start flying in water, but entering water while flying doesn't stop flying
            - When flying underwater from this, boosting on jump input interferes with swimming input to go up
        - Merge swimming/flying states?
    - Changing dimensions while elytra flying causes wind noise to get stuck playing
